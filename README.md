### Hi there 👋 

I am Yizhu, a web app developper from @Le Wagon summer bootcamp 441 🤩 (framework of Ruby on Rails) with training of Data Science (Wagon batch #552). I was a professional buyer for international tradings for 10 years before made my move to become a developper. Check my profile in details 👉  [HERE](https://agnes-lain.github.io/cv_yizhu_zong/)

I love coding, even if it drives me crazy sometimes🤯...but when I find the solution and got things done, I feel like a super Mario has found his magic mushrooms 🍄

But the world of code is like an ocean here 🌊 , we never know how deep and wide it can be...well, I try to dive a bit each day to find out a pixel of it 🍰 ...it will take me quite times I guess, but the good news is...I will never get bord 🌈
