### Hi there 👋 

I am Yizhu, a freshly certificated web app developper from @Le Wagon summer bootcamp 441 🤩 (framework of Ruby on Rails).  Check my profile in details 👉  [HERE](https://agnes-lain.github.io/cv_yizhu_zong/)

I love coding, even if it drives me crazy sometimes🤯...but when I find the solution and got things done, I feel like a super Mario has found his magic mushrooms 🌟 🌟

But the world of code is like an ocean here 🌊 , we never know how deep and wide it can be...well, I try to dive a bit each day to find out a pixel of it 🍰 ...it will take me quite times I guess, but the good news is...I will never get bord 🌈

- 🔭 I’m currently working on 
    - https://gameclan.herokuapp.com/ a social gamer platform to test the use of API, ajax with stimulus controllers, stimulus controller with action cable controller combination...
    - help to fix some bugs of "side-ninja" and develop few features for it.(platforms for sideprojects).
    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
    - Data Science bootcamps of le Wagon. Right now we are in the 2nd weeks of machine learning, very challenge indeed and hard. 
    - tests for rails.
    - Ajax tricks for rails, with stimulus controller, async/await, etc...
    - learn React:
         - excercise 1: https://agnes-lain.github.io/react-gifs/
         - excercise 2: https://agnes-lain.github.io/react-flats/
    - things catch my eyes from newsletter or forums...
    
- 🚀 my road map:
    - Python webdevelop frameworks
    - Code a sudoku react app for my 5 years son with cutter design (maybe with animals, letters, not just numbers ^ ^ )
    - an e-commerce shop sample with Spree / Solidus
    - A final project for my data science bootcamp
    - not sure after the data science bootcamps, what inspiration I will get and which path I will move on... will see :)
    
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with almost everthing I don't understand, and a job
