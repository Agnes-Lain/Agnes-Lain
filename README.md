### Hi there 👋 

I am Yizhu, a web app developper from @Le Wagon summer bootcamp 441 🤩 (framework of Ruby on Rails) with training of Data Science (Wagon batch #552). I was a professional buyer for international tradings for 15 years before made my move to become a developper. Check my profile in details 👉  [HERE](https://agnes-lain.github.io/cv_yizhu_zong/)

I love coding, even if it drives me crazy sometimes🤯...but when I find the solution and got things done, I feel like a super Mario has found his magic mushrooms 🍄

But the world of code is like an ocean here 🌊 , we never know how deep and wide it can be...well, I try to dive a bit each day to find out a pixel of it 🍰 ...it will take me quite times I guess, but the good news is...I will never get bord 🌈

- 🎄 [ADVENT OF CODE challenges](https://adventofcode.com/) is my new favorite for this cold December, am I getting 50 🌟 at Xmas? We will see ^^ ➡️  [My solutions](https://github.com/Agnes-Lain/advent-of-code-2021)

- 🔭 A flagship project worked during my web development & Data Science bootcamps:
    - https://gameclan.herokuapp.com/ a social gamer platform to test the use of API, ajax with stimulus controllers, stimulus controller with action cable controller combination, with an unsupervise learning prediction api(written in python) hosted on google cloud service, for game recommendation.
    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
    - TDD.
    - Set Rails as API with devise authentification.
    - React-Native as front to combine with Rails on the back to create mobile app.
    
- 🚀 my road map:
    - Job hunting for PM
    - Get back my developer level to launch some personal projects :
        - Chatbot mobile app mvp
        - Parenting mobile app mvp
    
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with almost everthing I don't understand 🙏💡🌟
