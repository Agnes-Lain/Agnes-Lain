### Hi there 👋

I am Yizhu, a freshly certificated web app developper from @Le Wagon summer bootcamp 441 🤩
I love coding, even if it drives me crazy sometimes🤯...but when I find the solution and got things done, I feel like a super Mario has found his magic mushrooms 🌟 🌟

But the world of code is like an ocean here 🌊 , we never know how deep and wide it can be...well, I try to dive a bit each day to find out a pixel of it 🍰 ...it will take me quite times I guess, but the good news is...I will never get bord 🌈

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a small gamer platform , an e-commerce shop sample, help to fix some bugs of an app 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react, and tests for rails, and things catch my eyes from newsletter or forums...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with almost everthing I don't understand, and a job
